                <p>Bill was a voracious reader as a child, 
<p>spending many hours pouring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. 
<p>Around the age of 11 or 12, Bill's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. 
<p>He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times. 
<p>His parents worried he might become a loner.
 <p>Though they were strong believers in public education</p>
           <p>hen Bill turned 13, they enrolled him at Seattle's Lakeside School,
 <p>an exclusive preparatory school. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, 
<p>excelling in math and science, 
<p>but also doing very well in drama and English.
